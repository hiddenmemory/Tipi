# [Discount][] instructions #

This folder holds the files generated by discount's `configure.sh` script that are used by MarkdownLive.

## Upgrading discount ##

Discount is included as a [fake submodule][]. To upgrade or test other versions of discount, delete the files in the `discount` directory and clone a new local repository into it:

	rm -rf discount/
	git clone git://github.com/Orc/discount.git discount

## Config files ##

When discount is changed, regenerate the config files. The included `update.sh` script should do this automatically.

If you want to update the files by hand, remove the "configuration for markdown, generated" comments at the head of `config.h` to avoid adding needless patches to the git history.
