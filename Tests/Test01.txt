Description: 

*Progression Player* is an application that allows a kitesurfer to buy training videos, download and watch them on their iDevice and watch them whenever they want. Whether that be in the comfort of their own home, streaming over AirPlay to their Apple TV, or on some remote beach enjoying sun and strong winds.
